Game Mechanics (GAME_MECHANICS.md)

This document explains the core mechanics of the game, including resources, assets, and how to expand your game studio.

1. Core Resources

There are three main resources in the game that are fundamental to the development of your studio:

    Creativity (resource_1): A mental resource used to develop new games, identified in the code by the key `resource_1`. It is automatically generated by employees such as engineers.

    Productivity (resource_2): A technical resource, identified in the code by the key `resource_2`, also used for developing new games and is a necessary cost to maintain completed games. It is automatically generated by employees such as engineers.

    Money (resource_3): The main capital required for game development, identified in the code by the key `resource_3`. It can be earned through completed games.

2. Assets

Assets are items that can generate resources or income for you, and are primarily divided into two categories:

    Employees:

        Level 1 Engineer (engineer_level_1): This is the basic employee in the current game. Each Level 1 Engineer continuously generates Creativity and Productivity for you.

    Games:

        Novel Game: One of the game types available for development.

        Puzzle Game: One of the game types available for development.

3. Ways to Increase Assets

You can expand your assets in the following two ways:

Method 1: Hire Employee

    Description: This method allows you to increase the number of employees in your studio. Currently, the "Hire Employee" feature is not fully implemented but is planned for the future.

    Producible Assets:

        Level 1 Engineer (The game currently starts with one by default)

        Level 2 Engineer (Planned for future updates)

Method 2: Develop Game

    Description: Invest resources to develop new game projects. You can view a list of all developable games, their costs, and expected income on the "Game Development" page. Completed games will provide you with a steady stream of income.

    Producible Assets:

        Novel Game

        Puzzle Game

4. Game Settings (settings.json)

All static data for the game, such as initial resources, employee attributes, and developable games, is stored in the settings.json file. This approach allows for easy adjustments to game balance without modifying the source code.

    initial: Defines the initial resources and assets when starting a new game.
        resources: Contains the core resources of the game, such as `resource_3` (Money), `resource_1` (Creativity), and `resource_2` (Productivity).
        assets: Contains the assets owned at the start of the game, such as the number of engineer_level_1.
